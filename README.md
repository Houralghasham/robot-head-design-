# robot-head-design-

We worked on designing the head of the robot using 'https://www.vectary.com/'
The design what we worked on based on Smart Methdos design, the special thing we did is we worked on
a sinus on the inside of the head to enable the tablet to be hiding inside, and a circle at the bottom
for the cabels to get through.
